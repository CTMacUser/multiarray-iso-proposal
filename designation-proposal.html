<h2 id="Ch02">II. Introduction</h2>

<p>As of the C++ 2014 drafts, initializer clauses in braced initialization
lists must be in the declared subobject order (not counting static data
members, unnamed bit fields, and skipped trailing subobjects). The 1999 edition
of the ISO C Standard adds the capability to override the order of subobject
initialization, including sub-subobjects. This proposal is to add this
capability to C++.</p>

<h2 id="Ch03">III. Motivation and Scope</h2>

<p>The motivation is to improve parity with C.</p>

<h2 id="Ch04">IV. Impact on the Standard</h2>

<p>The proposal adds to the initialization rules (section 8.5 [dcl.init]). At
least two implementations, Clang since version 2.8 and Microsoft's 2013 edition
of Visual Studio, incorporate this C99 feature into their C++11 compilers,
proving this proposal viable.</p>

<h2 id="Ch05">V. Design Decisions</h2>

<p>Specifying this feature should be as easy as importing the C Standard text
into the C++ Standard text, modulo how the two Standards differ in expressing
ideas. There are outstanding issues on how overriding initializations work when
said initializations are at the sub-subobject level; how are the unmentioned
sibling sub-subobjects initialized? (See forum post by Richard Smith.)</p>

<p>The elision rules ban subobjects of class types with multiple members,
therefore allowing class types of one member or array types. Thus this proposal
integrates N3526 by Michael Price. But I don't think I did it right; I think
N3526 allows a brace-levels between all or nothing, and this proposal
doesn't.</p>

<p>A post by Richard Smith suggested adding rules for how initializers are
sequenced.</p>

<p>The brace elision rules allowing class types of one member have changed to
class types of one member or a single pack of variants.</p>

<h2 id="Ch06">VI. Technical Specifications</h2>

<p>The changes are based off C++ Working Draft Standard N3797. The numbers for
new paragraphs and footnotes have place-holders; the final numbers, plus moving
existing ID numbers to fit, are to be determined later.</p>

<p>In section 8.5 [dcl.init], modify the grammar production list after
paragraph 1:</p>

<blockquote>

      <dd><code>{</code> <code>}</code></dd>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Add these changes to the last part of section A.7 [gram.decl]. And add the
terms <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>, <var>designator-list</var>, and
<var>designator</var> to the Index of grammar productions.</p>

<p><u>Author's Note:</u> I don't know if appropriate members can ever be
described that require the <code>template</code> keyword preceding them.</p>

<p>In the same section (8.5), add new paragraphs before paragraph 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-A-</strong> A <dfn>designator</dfn> is a token sequence
  representing a single element or member access from an unwritten reference to
  an object. When the implementation needs to synthesize
  <var>designator</var>s, any required numeric values are canonically
  represented by an integer-literal. A <var>designator-list</var> is a chain of
  <var>designator</var>s and represents nested access.</p>

  <p><strong>-B-</strong> A <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> (or pack
  expansion thereof) shall be permitted as a term of an
  <var>initializer-list</var> only when the immediately-enclosing
  <var>braced-init-list</var> corresponds to a object that is under aggregate
  initialization (8.5.1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In section 8.5.1 [dcl.init.aggr], modify paragraph 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-2-</strong> When an aggregate is initialized by an initializer
  list, as specified in 8.5.4, the elements of the initializer list are taken
  as initializers for <del>the members</del> <ins>subobjects</ins> of the
  aggregate, <del>in increasing subscript or member order</del> <ins>where an
  initializer's target object is explicitly addressed in
  <var>designated-initialization-clause</var>s and implicitly addressed in
  <var>initializer-clause</var>s</ins>. <del>Each member is copy-initialized
  from the corresponding <var>initializer-clause</var>.</del> <ins>Each
  subobject that is a target object, in whole or part, by multiple qualifying
  initializers is initialized in composite; otherwise a mentioned subobject is
  initialized by a single corresponding
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> (which may use either copy- or
  direct-initialization), or an implied subobject is copy-initialized by a
  single corresponding <var>initializer-clause</var>..</ins> If <del>the</del>
  <ins>either an</ins> <var>initializer-clause</var> <ins>or the
  post-<var>designator-list</var> part of a
  <var>designator-initializer-clause</var></ins> is an expression and a
  narrowing conversion (8.5.4) is required to convert the expression, the
  program is ill-formed. [<em>Note:</em> If <ins>either</ins> an
  <var>initializer-clause</var> <ins>or the post-<var>designator-list</var>
  part of a <var>designator-initializer-clause</var></ins> is itself an
  initializer list, the <del>member</del> <ins>target object</ins> is
  list-initialized, which will result in a recursive application of the rules
  in this section if the <del>member</del> <ins>target object</ins> is an
  aggregate. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] [<em>Example:</em></p>
  <pre>struct A {
  int x;
  struct B {
    int i;
    int j;
  } b;
} a = { 1, { 2, 3 } };</pre>

  <p>initializes <code>a.x</code> with 1, <code>a.b.i</code> with 2,
  <code>a.b.j</code> with 3. <em>&mdash;end example</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Add a paragraph before paragraph 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-A-</strong> The <dfn>directly settable subobjects</dfn> of an
  aggregate are the ones reachable using a single <var>designator</var>; for an
  array type, the subobjects are its (direct) elements; for a class type, its
  named non-static data members and any named variant members not already
  covered. [<em>Note:</em> For class types, the directly settable subobjects
  are the ones that could appear in a <var>mem-initializer-id</var> for a
  theoretical constructor of the class type. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] The
  subobjects have an order; for an array type, it is in increasing subscript
  value; for a class type, it is in the order declared in the class definition.
  The aggregate is considered the <dfn>initializing root</dfn> of these
  subobjects. [<em>Note:</em> Any named subobject that is not a directly
  settable subobject is either within a non-aggregate or a directly settable
  subobject of some subaggregate. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] Any subobject's
  <dfn>virtual designator list</dfn> is its initializing root's virtual
  designator list followed by the <var>designator</var> from the initializing
  root to the subobject, starting with a null list for the aggregate itself.
  The <dfn>designated successor</dfn> of a directly settable subobject, if it
  exists, is the first following one where neither share any
  immediately-enclosing unions. [<em>Note:</em> The last declared directly
  settable subobject has no designated successor, nor do any of its co-variant
  members (when the last subobject is a union member). <em>&mdash;end
  note</em>] [<em>Example:</em></p>
  <pre>#ifndef TEST
#define TEST 0
#endif

struct X {
  int a;
  static int b;
  int c;
  int :17;
  int d;
  int e[2];
  union { long f; float g; };
#if TEST
  double h;
#endif
} x;
  </pre>

  <p>The directly settable subobjects of <code>x.e</code> are
  <code>x.e[0]</code> and <code>x.e[1]</code>, ordered as listed. Within
  <code>x.e</code>, <code>x.e[0]</code>'s designated successor is
  <code>x.e[1]</code>, which itself has no designated successor. The directly
  settable subobjects of <code>x</code> are <code>x.a</code>, <code>x.c</code>,
  <code>x.d</code>, <code>x.e</code> (as a unit), <code>x.f</code>, and
  <code>x.g</code>, ordered as listed. Since <code>x.f</code> is under the same
  group of variants as <code>x.g</code>, it does not have a designated
  successor. If <code>TEST</code> gets predefined to a nonzero constant
  expression, then <code>x.h</code> would be the designated successor to both
  <code>x.f</code> and <code>x.g</code>, but have no designated successor
  itself. <em>&mdash;end example</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modify paragraph 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-4-</strong> An array of unknown <del>size</del> <ins>bound</ins>
  initialized with a <del>brace-enclosed <var>initializer-list</var></del>
  <ins><var>braced-init-list</var></ins> containing <del><code>n</code>
  <var>initializer-clauses</var>, where <code>n</code> shall be greater than
  zero,</del> <ins>a positive number of initializers</ins> is defined as having
  <var>n</var> elements (8.3.4)<ins>, where <dfn>n</dfn> is one greater than
  the maximum value among the initializers' target object's virtual designator
  list's first designator's subscripts</ins>. <ins>Until the bound needs to be
  known, the array shall be treated as if its element count approaches
  infinity.</ins> [<em>Example:</em></p>
  <pre>int x[] = { 1, 3, 5 };</pre>

  <p>declares and initializes <var>x</var> as a one-dimensional array that has
  three elements since no size was specified and there are three initializers.
  <em>&mdash;end example</em>] <ins>[<em>Example:</em></ins></p>
  <pre><ins>int y[][2] = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 };</ins></pre>

  <p><ins>declares and initializes <var>y</var> as a two-dimensional array of
  three elements, each an array of two elements. With a minimum designator
  length (see below) of 2, each pair of loose inner elements was grouped as an
  array of the outer element. The second element of the third outer array gets
  initialized with an empty list (i.e. zero). Since there are no
  <var>designator</var>s used, the last element's virtual designator list,
  <code>[2][0]</code>, also reveals the answer. <em>&mdash;end example</em>]
  [<em>Example:</em></ins></p>
  <pre><ins>int z[] = { 100, [3] = 101, 102, [1] = 103 };</ins></pre>

  <p><ins>declares and initializes <var>z</var> as a one-dimensional array. All
  the initializers' target objects have a single-element virtual designator
  list. Among the subscripts of the first designators of said lists, the
  maximum subscript is 4 (for the element of value 102 and virtual designator
  list <code>[4]</code>). So <var>z</var> is assigned an element length of 5.
  (The element with virtual designator list <code>[2]</code> is initialized
  with an empty list.) <em>&mdash;end example</em>]</ins> An empty initializer
  list <code>{}</code> shall not be used as the <var>initializer-clause</var>
  for an array of unknown bound<sup>107</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Footnote 107 is unchanged.)</p>

<p>Paragraph 5 should be removed. (<u>Author's Note:</u> Its main information
is now in paragraph A.)</p>

<p>Add a paragraph before paragraph 6:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-B-</strong> The target object of a
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> is the subobject whose virtual
  designator list is equivalent to the clause's <var>designator-list</var>; if
  no such subobject exists, the <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> shall
  be ill-formed; ill-formed behavior shall include when a <var>designator</var>
  in a <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> would reference: a static data
  member, a member within a non-aggregate, a non-existent member, an excessive
  subscript, an element as a subobject of a class type, or a member as a
  subobject of an array type. An <var>initializer-clause</var> in an aggregate
  with zero directly settable subobjects shall be ill-formed. The target object
  of an <var>initializer-clause</var> that is the first initializer is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the <var>initializer-clause</var> is an
      <var>assignment-expression</var> and if there is a subobject starting
      from the first directly settable subobject descending through inner first
      directly settable subobjects down to an inner non-aggregate such that
      copy-initialization with the <var>assignment-expression</var> is
      well-formed, and none of the (initializing root) ascendants of the
      subobject found are of a class type with either no directly settable
      subobjects or at least one directly settable subobject that has a
      designated successor, then that subobject shall be the
      <var>initializer-clause</var>'s target object.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, the first directly settable subobject shall be the
      <var>initializer-clause</var>'s target object.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <dfn>minimum designator length</dfn> of an aggregate is unity when
  there are no initializers or the first initializer is a
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>, otherwise it is the count of
  <var>designator</var>s in the virtual designator list of the first
  initializer's target object. The target object of an
  <var>initializer-clause</var> that is not the first initializer is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If there is no subobject starting from the previous initializer's
      target object ascending up to a directly settable subobject such that its
      virtual designator list's length is at most the minimum designator length
      and it has a designated successor, then the <var>initializer-clause</var>
      shall be ill-formed.</li>
    <li>Otherwise if there is no subobject starting from the just found
      subobject's designated successor descending through inner first directly
      settable subobjects down to an inner non-aggregate or inner aggregate
      with zero directly settable subobjects such that its virtual designator
      list's length equals the minimum designator length, then the
      <var>initializer-clause</var> shall be ill-formed.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, the just found subobject shall be the
      <var>initializer-clause</var>'s target object.</li>

<p>Modify paragraph 6:</p>

  <p><ins>is ill-formed due to the third initializer. <em>&mdash;end
  example</em>]</ins></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Add several paragraphs after paragraph 6:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-C-</strong> When an aggregate initialization for a non-union type
  is evaluated, the direct subobjects are initialized in order; an array type's
  initialization starts from the first element and proceeds in increasing
  subscript order while a class type's initialization starts from the first
  declared non-static data member and proceeds in succeeding declaration order,
  including anonymous bit-fields and class types, but excluding static data
  members. Evaluation occurs after pack expansions (14.5.3) for applicable
  <var>initializer-clause</var>s and <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>s
  have been resolved. [<em>Note:</em> Arrays of unknown bound have their bound
  fixed before evaluation, based on the (post-pack-expanded) initializers'
  target object's virtual designator lists, as described earlier.
  <em>&mdash;end note</em>] Every value computation and side effect associated
  with a given direct subobject's initialization is sequenced before every
  value and computation and side effect associated with initializations of
  later direct subobjects. [<em>Note:</em> This evaluation ordering holds
  regardless of the semantics of the aggregate initialization. <em>&mdash;end
  note</em>]</p>

  <p><strong>-D-</strong> Each initializer shall be matched with the direct
  subobject that is or contains that initializer's target object. If a direct
  subobject has no initializers that match with it, then its initialization
  shall be evaluated with its <var>brace-or-equal-initializer</var> or, if
  there is no <var>brace-or-equal-initializer</var>, an empty initializer list
  (8.5.4). If a direct subobject's lexically last matching initializer
  references the object in whole and does not use aggregate initialization,
  then its initialization shall be evaluated with said initializer.
  [<em>Note:</em> If the initializer is an <var>initializer-clause</var>, then
  copy-initialization is performed, else the type of initialization denoted by
  the post-<var>designator-list</var> part of the
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> is performed. <em>&mdash;end
  note</em>] [<em>Note:</em> An initializer matching a member of anonymous
  class type always references it in part. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] Otherwise,
  the direct subobject shall be evaluated with aggregate initialization; the
  subaggregate is a composite of all matching initializers except the ones
  before and at the lexically last matching initializer that references the
  object in whole and does not use aggregate initialization. The subaggregate
  is composed with: any matching initializer with an
  <var>initializer-clause</var> is converted to a
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> copy-initializing the same target
  object; any matching subaggregate initializer has its root-level
  <var>initializer-clause</var>s converted to
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>s (relative to the subaggregate)
  copy-initializing the same respective target objects [<em>Note:</em> The
  internals of sub-subaggregates are not altered. <em>&mdash;end note</em>];
  insertions to the composite occur in lexical order, with aggregate-level
  clauses inserted with their first <var>designator</var> removed, and the
  initializers within subaggregate-level clauses inserted directly.</p>

  <p><strong>-E-</strong> When an aggregate initialization for a union-type is
  evaluated, and the same variant member is or contains every initializer's
  target object, then the variant member shall be the active member of its
  enclosing union (Which is either the aggregate directly or an anonymous
  union; if the latter, said anonymous union is the active member of the
  aggregate.) and its initialization shall be evaluated with a subaggregate
  identical to the original aggregate except that any root-level
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>s lose their first designator.
  [<em>Note:</em> If there is an <var>initializer-clause</var> in the
  aggregate, it must be the only one, it must be the first one, and any
  trailing <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> must target the union's
  first variant member in whole or part. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] Targeting
  across multiple variant members is conditionally supported with
  implementation-defined semantics. When there are no initializers: if a
  variant member has a <var>brace-or-equal-initializer</var>, then that variant
  member shall be the active member of its immediately enclosing union and its
  initialization shall be evaluated with its
  <var>brace-or-equal-initializer</var>, else the first variant member shall be
  the active member of its immediately enclosing union and its initialization
  shall be evaluated with an empty initializer list; if the aggregate is not
  the variant member's immediate enclosing object, then the intermediate
  anonymous union is the active member of the aggregate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paragraph 7 should be removed. (<u>Author's Note:</u> Its main information
is now in paragraphs D and E.)</p>

<p><u>Author's Query</u>: Should paragraph 8 be removed? Its material is
sort-of implied from paragraphs A, B, and D. (The current paragraph 8 says that
empty subaggregate members can't be skipped unless the aggregate stops early.
The fact that paragraph B has non-first initializer-clauses always use
designated successors means no named member can be skipped outside of
co-variants unless the aggregate stops early and/or designators are used.)</p>

<p>Modify paragraph 9:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-9-</strong> If <del>an incomplete or empty initializer-list
  leaves a member of reference type uninitialized</del> <ins>a subobject of
  reference type and outside any non-aggregate is not the target object of any
  initializer</ins>, the program is ill-formed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paragraphs 10 and 11 should be removed. (<u>Author's Note:</u> Their main
information is now in paragraphs A and B.)</p>

<p>Modify paragraph 12:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-12-</strong> All implicit type conversions (Clause 4) are
  considered when initializing <del>the</del> <ins>an</ins> aggregate member
  with an <var>assignment-expression</var><ins>, i.e. without
  list-initialization</ins>. If the <var>assignment-expression</var> can
  initialize <del>a member</del> <ins>the target object</ins>, the
  <del>member</del> <ins>subobject</ins> is initialized. Otherwise, if the
  <del>member</del> <ins>target object</ins> is itself a subaggregate,
  <del>brace elision is assumed and the <var>assignment-expression</var> is
  considered for the initialization of the first member of the
  subaggregate</del> <ins>it is list-initialized with a list containing just
  the <var>assignment-expression</var></ins>. [<em>Note:</em> <del>As specified
  above, brace elision cannot apply to subaggregates with no members for
  purposes of aggregate initialization; an <var>initializer-clause</var> for
  the entire subobject is required.</del> <ins>Since that list-initialization
  would be ill-formed when the subaggregate has zero directly settable
  subobjects, the initializer is ill-formed unless the
  <var>assignment-expression</var> is of a type that has an implicit conversion
  to the subaggregate's type.</ins> <em>&mdash;end note</em>]

  with <code>a</code>, <code>b.z</code> is initialized with whatever
  <code>a.operator int()</code> returns. <em>&mdash;end example</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paragraphs 15 should be removed. (<u>Author's Note:</u> Its information is
covered by paragraph B.) <u>Author's Query:</u> The new syntax allows a union
that has an array as its first member to use "brace elision" (I purged the
term.) to fill the array's inner non-aggregate elements at the top aggregate
level. Is that allowed now? If not, should I keep support? (I think yes.)</p>

<p>Paragraph 16 should be removed. (<u>Author's Note:</u> Its main information
is covered by paragraph 12 plus what was needed by paragraph 15.)</p>

<p><u>Author's Query:</u> Can anyone provide examples that cover the (possibly)
removed paragraphs (5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16)? They should at least cover the
material the examples within those paragraphs did.</p>

<p>In section 8.5.4 [dcl.init.list], modify paragraph 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-4-</strong> Within the <var>initializer-list</var> of a
  <var>braced-init-list</var> <ins>that has no
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>s</ins>, the
  <var>initializer-clauses</var>, including any that result from pack
  expansions (14.5.3), are evaluated in the order in which they appear. That
  is, every value computation and side effect associated with a given
  <var>initializer-clause</var> is sequenced before every value computation and
  side effect associated with any <var>initializer-clause</var> that follows it
  in the comma-separated list of the <var>initializer-list</var>.
  [<em>Note:</em> This evaluation ordering holds regardless of the semantics of
  the initialization; for example, it applies when the elements of the
  <var>initializer-list</var> are interpreted as arguments of a constructor
  call, even though ordinarily there are no sequencing constraints on the
  arguments of a call. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] <ins>[<em>Note:</em> If the
  <var>initializer-list</var> contains
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>s, the <var>braced-init-list</var>
  must be for aggregate initialization (8.5.1). <em>&mdash;end
  note</em>]</ins></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In section 14.5.3 [temp.variadic], modify the third list item (not counting
the second item's inner list) of paragraph 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>In an <var>initializer-list</var> (8.5); the pattern is
      <ins>either</ins> an <var>initializer-clause</var> <ins>or
      <var>designated-initializer-clause</var></ins>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
