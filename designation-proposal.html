<h2 id="Ch02">II. Introduction</h2>

<p>As of the C++ 2014 drafts, initializer clauses in braced initialization
lists must be in the declared subobject order (not counting static data
members, unnamed bit fields, and skipped trailing subobjects). The 1999 edition
of the ISO C Standard adds the capability to override the order of subobject
initialization, including sub-subobjects. This proposal is to add this
capability to C++.</p>

<h2 id="Ch03">III. Motivation and Scope</h2>

<p>The motivation is to improve parity with C.</p>

<h2 id="Ch04">IV. Impact on the Standard</h2>

<p>The proposal adds to the initialization rules (section 8.5 [dcl.init]). At
least two implementations, Clang since version 2.8 and Microsoft's 2013 edition
of Visual Studio, incorporate this C99 feature into their C++11 compilers,
proving this proposal viable.</p>

<h2 id="Ch05">V. Design Decisions</h2>

<p>Specifying this feature should be as easy as importing the C Standard text
into the C++ Standard text, modulo how the two Standards differ in expressing
ideas. There are outstanding issues on how overriding initializations work when
said initializations are at the sub-subobject level; how are the unmentioned
sibling sub-subobjects initialized? (See forum post by Richard Smith.)</p>

<p>The elision rules ban subobjects of class types with multiple members,
therefore allowing class types of one member or array types. Thus this proposal
integrates N3526 by Michael Price. But I don't think I did it right; I think
N3526 allows a brace-levels between all or nothing, and this proposal
doesn't.</p>

<p>A post by Richard Smith suggested adding rules for how initiaizers are
sequenced.</p>

<h2 id="Ch06">VI. Technical Specifications</h2>

<p>The changes are based off C++ Working Draft Standard N3797. The numbers for
new paragraphs and footnotes have place-holders; the final numbers, plus moving
existing ID numbers to fit, are to be determined later.</p>

<p>In section 8.5 [dcl.init], modify the grammar production list after
paragraph 1:</p>

<blockquote>

      <dd><code>{</code> <code>}</code></dd>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Add these changes to the last part of section A.7 [gram.decl]. And add the
terms <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>, <var>designator-list</var>, and
<var>designator</var> to the Index of grammar productions.</p>

<p><u>Author's Note:</u> I don't know if appropriate members can ever be
described that require the <code>template</code> keyword preceding them.</p>

<p>In the same section (8.5), add a new paragraph before paragraph 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-A-</strong> A <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> (or pack
  expansion thereof) shall be permitted as a term of an
  <var>initializer-list</var> only when the immediately-enclosing
  <var>braced-init-list</var> corresponds to a object that is under aggregate
  initialization (8.5.1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In section 8.5.1 [dcl.init.aggr], add several new paragraphs before
paragraph 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-A-</strong> An aggregate type's <dfn>first-order initialization
  list</dfn> is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For an array type, its (direct) elements, in increasing subscript
      order. For an array of unknown bound, the maximum subscript approaches
      infinity.</li>
    <li>For a class type, its non-static data members, in declaration order,
      but excluding anonymous bit-fields, and replacing non-static members of
      anonymous class type with the member's own first-order initialization
      list. [<em>Note:</em> A list may end up empty for class types.
      <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If all the entries of a first-order initialization list have aggregate
  types themselves, then the aggregate type's second-order initialization list
  is formed by replacing each entry of the previous-order initialization list
  with their own first-order initialization lists. This process can be repeated
  until a given nth-order initialization list has at least one non-aggregate
  entry. That last list is of the aggregate type's <dfn>maximum initialization
  list order</dfn>. [<em>Note:</em> Nth-order initialization lists are ordered
  lists. <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</p>

  <p><strong>-B-</strong> For a given <var>assignment-expression</var>
  <var>Y</var> and aggregate type, their elision order <var>N</var> is the
  lowest value where the first entry of the aggregate type's
  <var>N</var>th-order initialization list can be copy-initialized by
  <var>Y</var> and be well-formed. If the maximum-order initialization list is
  reached and usage of <var>Y</var> would still be ill-formed, or if any
  transition between orders involves expanding a class type with a first-order
  initialization list that is not exactly one in length, then the elision order
  shall be one.</p>

  <p><strong>-C-</strong> The <dfn>designation label</dfn> of an entry of an
  aggregate type's first-order initialization list is the sequence of tokens
  that has to follow an expression of the aggregate type in order to access the
  entry's corresponding subobject. [<em>Note:</em> Many token sequences may
  represent a subscript in an array <var>designator</var>, as long as a
  sequence resolves to a <var>constant-expression</var> of a nonnegative value
  of integer type. The canonical token sequence for a designation label is a
  literal. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] The designation label for a nested entry
  is the label for the entry's enclosing subaggregate (for which the nested
  entry is a first-order initialization list entry) followed by the label of
  the entry relative to said subaggregate. [<em>Note:</em> Members of a
  non-aggregate class type do not have designation labels. <em>&mdash;end
  note</em>]</p>

  <p><strong>-D-</strong> An entry in an aggregate type's nth-order
  initialization list can have a <dfn>designated-follower</dfn>, which is
  another entry of the list. If the entry is not a direct subobject of a union,
  its designated-follower is its immediate successor. Otherwise its
  designated-follower is the first succeeding entry whose subobject is not part
  of any of the current entry's subobject's immediately-enclosing unions. If
  the end of the list is reached before identifying a qualified successor, then
  the entry has no designated-follower. [<em>Note:</em> The list has no end if
  the aggregate type is an array of unknown bound. <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</p>

  <p><strong>-E-</strong> Each initializer in an aggregate initialization has a
  <dfn>virtual designator list</dfn>. The virtual designator list for a
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> is the clause's actual
  <var>designator-list</var>. If <var>N</var> is the order of the
  initialization list that the aggregate initialization is using, then the
  virtual designator list for an <var>initializer-clause</var> is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The designation label of the first entry of the aggregate type's
      <var>N</var>th-order initialization list, when the clause is the first
      initializer.</li>
    <li>The designation label of the <var>designated-follower</var> of the
      entry that the previous clause references, when the current clause
      follows either another <var>initializer-clause</var> or a
      <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> with a
      <var>designation-list</var> of length <var>N</var>.</li>
    <li>The designation label of the <var>designated-follower</var> of entry
      <var>X</var>, where <dfn>X</dfn> is the entry that the previous clause
      references minus enough trailing <var>designator</var>s to make its
      designator count <var>N</var>, when the current clause follows a
      <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> with a
      <var>designation-list</var> of a length greater than <var>N</var>.
      [<em>Note:</em> Designation lists of fewer than <var>N</var> designators
      are ill-formed. <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>-F-</strong> The <dfn>target object</dfn> for an initializer in an
  aggregate initialization is the subobject of the aggregate that would be
  referenced if an expression representing the aggregate is appended by the
  initializer's virtual designator list. An <dfn>initializer override</dfn> is
  a circumstance that can cause an initializer to be ignored. If a target
  object is an aggregate, it is possible for it to be partially overridden, if
  only some of its subobjects (also called <dfn>target subobjects</dfn>)
  receive initializer overrides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then modify paragraph 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-2-</strong> When an aggregate is initialized by an initializer
  list, as specified in 8.5.4, the elements of the initializer list are taken
  as initializers for <del>the members</del> <ins>subobjects</ins> of the
  aggregate, in <del>increasing subscript or member</del> order <ins>of the
  aggregate type's <var>N</var>th-order initialization list (modulo jumps
  caused by <var>designated-initialization-clause</var>s), where <dfn>N</dfn>
  is the elision order of the aggregate type and the first initializer if said
  initializer is an <var>assignment-expression</var>, and one otherwise</ins>.
  <del>Each member is copy-initialized from the corresponding
  <var>initializer-clause</var>.</del> <ins>The non-overridden parts of an
  <var>initializer-clause</var> have their target subobjects copy-initialized.
  The non-overridden parts of a <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> have
  their target subobjects copy-initialized if the clause denotes
  copy-initialization, and direct-initialized otherwise.</ins> If
  <del>the</del> <ins>either an</ins> <var>initializer-clause</var> <ins>or the
  post-<var>designator-list</var> part of a
  <var>designator-initializer-clause</var></ins> is an expression and a
  narrowing conversion (8.5.4) is required to convert the expression, the
  program is ill-formed. [<em>Note:</em> If <ins>either</ins> an
  <var>initializer-clause</var> <ins>or the post-<var>designator-list</var>
  part of a <var>designator-initializer-clause</var></ins> is itself an
  initializer list, the <del>member</del> <ins>target object</ins> is
  list-initialized, which will result in a recursive application of the rules
  in this section if the <del>member</del> <ins>target object</ins> is an
  aggregate. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] [<em>Example:</em></p>
  <pre>struct A {
  int x;
  struct B {
    int i;
    int j;
  } b;
} a = { 1, { 2, 3 } };</pre>

  <p>initializes <code>a.x</code> with 1, <code>a.b.i</code> with 2,
  <code>a.b.j</code> with 3. <em>&mdash;end example</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then modify paragraph 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-4-</strong> An array of unknown <del>size</del> <ins>bound</ins>
  initialized with a <del>brace-enclosed <var>initializer-list</var></del>
  <ins><var>braced-init-list</var></ins> containing <del><code>n</code>
  <var>initializer-clauses</var>, where <code>n</code> shall be greater than
  zero,</del> <ins>a positive number of initializers</ins> is defined as having
  <var>n</var> elements (8.3.4)<ins>, where <dfn>n</dfn> is one greater than
  the maximum value among the initializers' virtual designator list's first
  delegator's subscripts</ins>. [<em>Example:</em></p>
  <pre>int x[] = { 1, 3, 5 };</pre>

  <p>declares and initializes <var>x</var> as a one-dimensional array that has
  three elements since no size was specified and there are three initializers.
  <em>&mdash;end example</em>] <ins>[<em>Example:</em></ins></p>
  <pre><ins>int y[][2] = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 };</ins></pre>

  <p><ins>declares and initializes <var>y</var> as a two-dimensional array of
  three elements, each an array of two elements. With an elision order of 2,
  each pair of loose inner elements was grouped as an array of the outer
  element. The second element of the third outer array gets initialized with an
  empty list (i.e. zero). Since there are no <var>designator</var>s used, the
  last element's virtual designator list, <code>[2][0]</code>, also reveals the
  answer. <em>&mdash;end example</em>] [<em>Example:</em></ins></p>
  <pre><ins>int z[] = { 100, [3] = 101, 102, [1] = 103 };</ins></pre>

  <p><ins>declares and initializes <var>z</var> as a one-dimensional array. All
  the initializers have a single element virtual designator list. Among the
  subscripts of the first designators of said lists, the maximum subscript is 4
  (for the element of value 102 and virtual designator list <code>[4]</code>).
  So <var>z</var> is assigned an element length of 5. (The element with virtual
  designator list <code>[2]</code> is initialized with an empty list.)
  <em>&mdash;end example</em>]</ins> An empty initializer list <code>{}</code>
  shall not be used as the <var>initializer-clause</var> for an array of
  unknown bound<sup>107</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Footnote 107 is unchanged.)</p>

<p>Paragraph 5 should be removed. (<u>Author's Note:</u> Its main information
is now in paragraph A.)</p>

<p>Modify paragraph 6:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-6-</strong> An <var>initializer-list</var><ins>, using an

  class type, a member as a subobject of array type, or anything that would go
  beyond the last entry of the aggregate type's <var>N</var>th-order
  initialization list</ins>. [<em>Example:</em></p>
  <pre>char cv[4] = { &rsquo;a&rsquo;, &rsquo;s&rsquo;, &rsquo;d&rsquo;, &rsquo;f&rsquo;, 0 }; <i>// error</i></pre>

  <p>is ill-formed. <em>&mdash;end example</em>] <ins>[<em>Note:</em> A pack
  expansion of an <var>initializer-clause</var> or

  note</em>] If a <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> uses a
  <var>designator-list</var> of a length shorter than the order of the
  initialization list, the <var>initializer-list</var> is ill-formed.
  [<em>Example:</em></ins></p>

  <p><ins>is ill-formed due to the third initializer. <em>&mdash;end
  example</em>]</ins></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Add several paragraphs after paragraph 6:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-G-</strong> An <var>initializer-list</var> can be
  <dfn>flattened</dfn> as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Replace each initializer that is an <var>initializer-clause</var> with
      a <var>designated-initializer-clause</var> with an
      <var>designator-list</var> equal to the virtual designator list of the
      <var>initializer-clause</var> it replaces, using copy-initialization to
      connect the <var>designator-list</var> to the old initializer.</li>
    <li>If an initializer uses aggregate initialization, flatten the
      subaggregate's <var>initializer-list</var>. And then replace the
      initializer with the initializers from the subaggregate, prepending the
      subaggregate's virtual designator list to the new initializers'
      <var>designator-list</var>s. The new initializers use the same copy-
      versus direct-initialization style as their old encloser.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>-H-</strong> A flattened <var>initializer-list</var> can be
  <dfn>reduced</dfn> as follows: start from the last initializer, mark as
  overridden any non-overridden initializers that have a target object that
  overlaps with the current initializer's target object, iterate backwards to
  the next non-overridden initializer until there are no more in that
  direction, then remove the initializers that were overridden. Two target
  objects <dfn>overlap</dfn> if their regions of storage have at least one byte
  in common and, if the target objects compose (in part or whole) different
  variant members of a union member (of any nesting level), they have common
  bits within those common bytes. [<em>Note:</em> Bit-wise comparison is needed
  only if at least one of the target objects is a bit-field. <em>&mdash;end
  note</em>] [<em>Note:</em> Two initializers referring to the same target
  object always overlap. If a target object is a (direct or nested) subobject
  of another, they always overlap. <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</p>

  <p><strong>-I-</strong> Within the <var>initializer-list</var> of a
  <var>braced-init-list</var> for an aggregate initialization, the
  <var>initializer-clauses</var> and <var>designated-initializer-clauses</var>,
  including any that result from pack expansions (14.5.3), are evaluated
  thusly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The initializer-list is replaced with its reduced and flattened
      version, if not already one.</li>
    <li>Each direct subobject has its initialization evaluated in a set order.
      Every value computation and side effect associated with a given direct
      subobject's initialization is sequenced before every value computation
      and side effect associated with initializations of later direct
      subobjects. [<em>Note:</em> This evaluation ordering holds regardless of
      the semantics of the aggregate initialization. <em>&mdash;end
    note</em>]</li>
    <li>If a direct subobject has no initializers that reference it, in part(s)
      or in whole, that subobject shall be initialized with an empty
      initializer list. If the subobject is of reference type, or otherwise
      cannot use empty list initialization, the whole initialization is
      ill-formed.</li>
    <li>If a direct subobject is referenced in whole by an initializer, then
      the subobject shall be initialized by the post-<var>designator-list</var>
      part of that initializer (using copy- or direct-initialization as
      denoted).</li>
    <li>If a direct subobject is referenced in part(s) by any initializers,
      then the subobject shall be initialized with aggregate initialization,
      with the noted initializers as the terms of the subaggregate. Within the
      subaggregate's initialization, the first <var>designator</var> of the
      <var>designation-list</var> for each term is removed.</li>
    <li>When the aggregate is of array type, the direct subobjects are the
      elements of the array and are evaluated in increasing subscript order.
      [<em>Note:</em> An array of unknown bound is resolved to an array of
      known bound before this, based on the initializers' virtual designator
      lists, as noted earlier. <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</li>
    <li>When the aggregate is of non-union class type, the direct subobjects
      are the non-static data members of the object and are evaluated in
      increasing declaration order. Anonymous bit-fields and anonymous objects
      of class type are included. [<em>Note:</em> Subobjects of a direct object
      of anonymous class type have any potential initializer evaluation done
      within their encloser's initializer evaluation, not at a higher level.
      <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</li>
    <li>When the aggregate is of union type and all the initializers' target
      objects are within a single variant member, only that specific direct
      subobject is evaluated. If the variant member is targeted in whole, then
      the rule for direct subobjects referenced in whole applies, otherwise the
      rule for direct subobjects referenced in part(s) applies.</li>
    <li>When the aggregate is of union type and the initializers' target
      objects are split among multiple variant members, then evaluation is
      conditionally supported with implementation-defined semantics. All
      trivial union types shall be supported.</li>

<p><u>Author's Query:</u> Can anyone provide examples that cover the (possibly)
removed paragraphs (5, 7 &ndash; 11, 15, 16)? They should at least cover the
material the examples within those paragraphs did.</p>

<p>In section 8.5.4 [dcl.init.list], modify paragraph 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-4-</strong> Within the <var>initializer-list</var> of a
  <var>braced-init-list</var> <ins>that has no
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>s</ins>, the
  <var>initializer-clauses</var>, including any that result from pack
  expansions (14.5.3), are evaluated in the order in which they appear. That
  is, every value computation and side effect associated with a given
  <var>initializer-clause</var> is sequenced before every value computation and
  side effect associated with any <var>initializer-clause</var> that follows it
  in the comma-separated list of the <var>initializer-list</var>.
  [<em>Note:</em> This evaluation ordering holds regardless of the semantics of
  the initialization; for example, it applies when the elements of the
  <var>initializer-list</var> are interpreted as arguments of a constructor
  call, even though ordinarily there are no sequencing constraints on the
  arguments of a call. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] <ins>[<em>Note:</em> If the
  <var>initializer-list</var> contains
  <var>designated-initializer-clause</var>s, the <var>braced-init-list</var>
  must be for aggregate initialization (8.5.1). <em>&mdash;end
  note</em>]</ins></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In section 14.5.3 [temp.variadic], modify the third list item (not counting
the second item's inner list) of paragraph 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>In an <var>initializer-list</var> (8.5); the pattern is
      <ins>either</ins> an <var>initializer-clause</var> <ins>or
      <var>designated-initializer-clause</var></ins>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
