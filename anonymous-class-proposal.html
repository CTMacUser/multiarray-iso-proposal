<h2 id="Ch02">II. Introduction</h2>

<p>Anonymous class types are an idea started by C++ (since 1998) with anonymous
unions. Then the 2011 version of C added the feature, but for
<code>struct</code>s and unions. This proposal adds anonymous
<code>struct</code>s and classes to C++.</p>

<h2 id="Ch03">III. Motivation and Scope</h2>

<p>The motivation is to improve parity with C.</p>

<h2 id="Ch04">IV. Impact on the Standard</h2>

<p>Loosening restrictions on which class types can be anonymous requires
changes to Clause 9 [class]. I think GCC and Microsoft Visual Studio, which
work with C11 and C++(11) code, have limited support for this feature.</p>

<h2 id="Ch05">V. Design Decisions</h2>

<h2 id="Ch06">VI. Technical Specifications</h2>

<p>The changes are based off C++ Working Draft Standard N3797. The numbers for
new paragraphs have place-holders; the final numbers, plus moving existing ID
numbers to fit, are to be determined later.</p>

<p>In section 8.5.1 [dcl.init.aggr], modify paragraph 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-5-</strong> Static data members and anonymous bit-fields are not
  considered members of the class for purposes of aggregate initialization.
  [<em>Example:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>struct A {
  int i;
  static int s;
  int j;
  int :17;
  int k;
} a = { 1, 2, 3 };</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here, the second initializer 2 initializes <code>a.j</code> and not the
  static data member <code>A::s</code>, and the third initializer 3 initializes
  <code>a.k</code> and not the anonymous bit-field before it. <em>&mdash;end
  example</em>] <ins>Anonymous classes are considered members of the class for
  purposes of aggregate initialization only when they do not (directly or
  indirectly) contain any named members that could be elevated to the scope of
  the class. [<em>Note:</em> These anonymous classes are treated as
  subaggregates that do not have members for purposes of aggregate
  initialization. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] Otherwise, an anonymous class is
  not considered a member of the class for purposes of aggregate
  initialization, but its (direct or nested) named members that could be
  elevated to the scope of the class are. [<em>Example:</em></ins></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre><ins>struct B {
  struct { };
  union { struct { int z, y, x }, double w; };
  double v;
} b = { {}, {}, 1, 2, 3.0 };</ins></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p><ins>Here, the second empty-braces initializer value-initializes
  <code>b.z</code> and not the anonymous structure enclosing it or the
  anonymous union surrounding that. The fifth initializer 3 initializes
  <code>b.v</code> and not <code>b.w</code>, since the latter and
  <code>b.z</code> are conflicting members (9.5). <em>&mdash;end
  example</em>]</ins></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The explanation that <code>b.w</code> gets skipped since it is on a
different variant branch from <code>b.z</code>, <code>b.y</code>, and
<code>b.x</code> is in paragraph 15. The only way <code>b.w</code> could be
part of the initializer is if delegated initializers are added to the language.
(I'm working on that, too.)</p>

<p>Modify paragraphs 15 and 16:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-15-</strong> When a union is initialized with a brace-enclosed
  initializer, the braces shall only contain <del>an</del>
  <var>initializer-clause</var><ins>s</ins> for the first non-static data
  member of the union <ins>and subsequent members that do not conflict with any
  member corresponding to a previous <var>initializer-clause</var></ins>.
  [<em>Example:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>union u { int a; const char* b; };
u a = { 1 };
u b = a;
u c = 1;                       <i>// error</i>
u d = { 0, "asdf" };           <i>// error</i>
u e = { "asdf" };              <i>// error</i>

<ins>union v { long a; struct { bool b; char c; }; };
v f = { 2L };
v g = f;
v h = { 3L, true };            <i>// error</i>

union w { struct { bool a; short b; union { long c; int d; }; }; double e; };
w i = { false };               <i>// latter part of struct default-initialized</i>
w j = { true, 4, 5L };
w k = j;
w l = { false, -6, 7L, 8 };    <i>// error, either d and e would conflict if mapped to the 8</i></ins></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>&mdash;end example</em>]</p>

  <p><strong>-16-</strong> [<em>Note:</em> As described above, the braces
  around the <var>initializer-clause</var> for a union member can be omitted if
  the union is a member of another aggregate <ins>and non-anonymous</ins>.
  <ins>The <var>initializer-clause</var>s for members of an anonymous class
  elevated to its containing aggregate must not be surrounded with braces if
  there is more than one elevated member being initialized.</ins>
  <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The added last sentence for paragraph 16 is because C11 does not include
inner anonymous composites in aggregate initialization, just the members of
those composites that get elevated. So you don't have the option of
un-elevating the affected members by surrounding them with braces (to represent
the anonymous composite as a unit). When only one member of an anonymous class
gets elevated, it can be surrounded by gratuitous braces.</p>

<p>In the root section of Clause 9 [class], append the following paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-A-</strong> An unnamed class of the form</p>

  <blockquote>
    <var>class-key</var> <var>attribute-specifier-seq<sub>opt</sub></var>
    <code>{</code> <var>member-specification</var> <code>}</code>
  <code>;</code></blockquote>

  <p>is called an <dfn>anonymous class</dfn>; it defines an unnamed object of
  unnamed type. [<em>Note:</em> Anonymous classes with the <code>struct</code>
  or <code>union</code> <var>class-key</var> may be called <dfn>anonymous
  structures</dfn> and <dfn>anonymous unions</dfn>, respectively.
  <em>&mdash;end note</em>] The <var>member-specification</var> of an anonymous
  class shall only define non-static data members. [<em>Note:</em> Nested types
  and functions cannot be declared within an anonymous class. <em>&mdash;end
  note</em>] The names of the members of an anonymous class shall be distinct
  from the names of any other entity in the scope in which the anonymous class
  is declared. For the purpose of name lookup, after the anonymous class
  definition, the members of the anonymous class are considered to have been
  defined in the scope in which the anonymous class is declared, called its
  <dfn>elevated scope</dfn>. An anonymous class nested in another use the same
  elevated scope; the referenced scope for the names and definitions of the
  members of the inner anonymous class shall be the scope the outer anonymous
  class would reference. [<em>Example:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>void f() {
  union { int a; const char* p; struct { char b; short c; }; };
  a = 1;
  p = "Jennifer";
  b = '\t';
  c = -5;
}</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here <code>a</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>
  are used like ordinary (nonmember) variables, but since they are union
  members they (except for <code>c</code>) have the same address and only
  <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> can active at the same time. <em>&mdash;end
  example</em>]</p>

  <p><strong>-B-</strong> Anonymous classes declared in a named namespace or in
  the global namespace shall be declared <code>static</code>. Anonymous classes
  declared at block scope shall be declared with any storage class allowed for
  a block-scope variable, or with no storage class. A storage class is not
  allowed in a declaration of an anonymous class in a class scope. An anonymous
  class shall not have <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code> members
  (Clause 11). An anonymous class shall not have function members.</p>

  <p><strong>-C-</strong> An unnamed class that ends an
  <var>alias-declaration</var>, is used as a function return type, or starts an
  declaration that includes declarators (<i>e.g.</i> objects, pointers,
  references, <var>typedef-name</var>s) is not an anonymous class.
  [<em>Example:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>void g() {
  class { public: int aa; char* p; } obj, *ptr = &amp;obj;
  aa = 1;                         <i>// error</i>
  ptr-&gt;aa = 1;                    <i>// OK</i>
}</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The assignment to plain <code>aa</code> is ill-formed since the member
  name is not visible outside the class, and even if it were visible, it is not
  associated with any particular object. <em>&mdash;end example</em>]
  [<em>Note:</em> Initialization of classes with no user-declared constructors
  is described in (8.5.1). <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The root of Clause 9 is my best guess for which section these paragraphs
should go in. Any better ideas?</p>

<p>In section 9.2 [class.mem], modify paragraph 14:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-14-</strong> If <code>T</code> is the name of a class, then each
  of the following shall have a name different from <code>T</code>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>every static data member of class <code>T</code>;</li>
    <li>every member function of class <code>T</code> [<em>Note:</em> This
      restriction does not apply to constructors, which do not have names
      (12.1) <em>&mdash;end note</em>];</li>
    <li>every member of class <code>T</code> that is itself a type;</li>
    <li>every enumerator of every member of class <code>T</code> that is an
      unscoped enumerated type; and</li>
    <li>every member of every anonymous <del>union</del> <ins>class</ins> that
      is a member of class <code>T</code><ins>, and every member of nested
      anonymous classes that also use <code>T</code>'s
      <var>class-specifier</var> as their elevated scope</ins>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Does paragraph 1, or some other place, have to be changed to specify that
names from within anonymous classes are in the same pool as direct data members
in terms that they can't be reused within the elevated-scoped class's
definition?</p>

<p>In section 9.5 [class.union], delete paragraphs 5&ndash;7 and modify
paragraph 8:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-8-</strong> A <dfn>union-like class</dfn> is a union or a class
  that has an anonymous union as a direct member <ins>or in a nesting of
  anonymous classes</ins>. A union-like class <code>X</code> has a set of
  <dfn>variant members</dfn>. If <code>X</code> is a union, a non-static data
  member of <code>X</code> that is not an anonymous union is a variant member
  of <code>X</code>. In addition, a non-static data member of an anonymous
  union that <del>is a member</del> <ins>can be elevated to the scope</ins> of
  <code>X</code> is also a variant member of <code>X</code>. <ins>Two
  non-static data members within a class type, direct or nested, are
  <dfn>conflicting members</dfn> if the deepest nested class enclosing both
  members is a union, otherwise they are <dfn>non-conflicting
  members</dfn>.</ins> <del>At most one variant member of a union</del>
  <ins>Sets of variant members that are not, evaluated pair-wise, conflicting
  members</ins> may have <del>a</del>
  <var>brace-or-equal-initializer</var><ins>s</ins>. [<em>Example:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>union U {
  int x = 0;
  union { };
  union {
    int z;
    int y = 1; <i>// error: initialization for second variant member of U</i>
  };
};

<ins>union V {
  class { public: int a; };
  struct {
    struct {
      int b = 1;
      union {
        short c;
        char d = '\0';  <i>// OK: b and d are not conflicting members</i>
      };
    };
  };
};</ins></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p><ins>If <code>a</code> had a <var>brace-or-equal-initializer</var>, it
  would conflict with the ones in <code>V</code>'s anonymous
  <code>struct</code>'s anonymous <code>struct</code>. The unnamed member with
  initializers has variants within itself, <code>c</code> and <code>d</code>,
  so at most one of them can have an initializer.</ins> <em>&mdash;end
  example</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In section 12.6.2 [class.base.init], modify paragraph 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-5-</strong> A <var>ctor-initializer</var> may initialize a
  variant member of the constructor&rsquo;s class. <ins>A
  <var>ctor-initializer</var> may initialize members of (direct or nested)
  anonymous classes that can be elevated to the constructor's class's
  scope.</ins> If a <var>ctor-initializer</var> specifies more than one
  <var>mem-initializer</var> for the same member or for the same base class,
  the <var>ctor-initializer</var> is ill-formed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modify paragraph 8:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-8-</strong> In a non-delegating constructor, if a given
  non-static data member or base class is not designated by a
  <var>mem-initializer-id</var> (including the case where there is no
  <var>mem-initializer-list</var> because the constructor has no
  <var>ctor-initializer</var>) and the entity is not a virtual base class of an
  abstract class (10.4), then</p>
  <ul>
    <li>if the entity is a non-static data member that has a
      <var>brace-or-equal-initializer</var> and <del>either</del> <ins>it forms
      a non-conflicting member pair with every non-static data member that is
      designated by a <var>mem-initializer-id</var>, then</ins> 
      <ul>
        <li><del>the constructor&rsquo;s class is a union (9.5), and no other
          variant member of that union is designated by a
          <var>mem-initializer-id</var> or</del></li>
        <li><del>the constructor&rsquo;s class is not a union, and, if the
          entity is a member of an anonymous union, no other member of that
          union is designated by a <var>mem-initializer-id</var>,</del></li>
      </ul>
      <p>the entity is initialized as specified in 8.5;</p>
    </li>
    <li>otherwise, if the entity is an anonymous union or a variant member
      (9.5), no initialization is performed;</li>
    <li>otherwise, the entity is default-initialized (8.5).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>[<em>Note:</em> An abstract class (10.4) is never a most derived class,
  thus its constructors never initialize virtual base classes, therefore the
  corresponding <var>mem-initializer</var>s may be omitted. <em>&mdash;end
  note</em>] An attempt to initialize <del>more than one non-static data member
  of a union</del> <ins>at least two non-static data members that are
  (pair-wise) conflicting members</ins> renders the program ill-formed. After
  the call to a constructor for class <code>X</code> has completed, if a member
  of <code>X</code> is neither initialized nor given a value during execution
  of the <var>compound-statement</var> of the body of the constructor, the
  member has indeterminate value. [<em>Example:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>struct A {
  A();
};

struct B {
  B(int);
};

struct C {
  C() { }      <i>// initializes members as follows:</i>
  A a;         <i>// OK: calls A::A()</i>
  const B b;   <i>// error: B has no default constructor</i>
  int i;       <i>// OK: i has indeterminate value</i>
  int j = 5;   <i>// OK: j has the value 5</i>
