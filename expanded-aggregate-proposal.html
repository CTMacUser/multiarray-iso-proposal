<h2 id="Ch02">II. Introduction</h2>

<p>Aggregates are a subset of compound types based on the compound types of C
(arrays, <code>struct</code>s, and <code>union</code>s). This proposal loosens
the restrictions on C-incompatible class types being aggregates in C++.</p>

<h2 id="Ch03">III. Motivation and Scope</h2>

<p>The motivation is to improve "spiritual" parity with C. Some forum
discussions mentioned that certain C++ features that are banned on aggregates
do not conceptually violate the aggregate concept, but are features the C does
not have (and therefore did not have to worry about) and seemingly too
"advanced" for something "primitive" like aggregates.</p>

<h2 id="Ch04">IV. Impact on the Standard</h2>

<p>Loosening restrictions on class types being aggregates requires changes in
the sections pertaining to aggregates, mostly section 8.5.1 [dcl.init.aggr].
The author does not know of any extant implementations.</p>

<h2 id="Ch05">V. Design Decisions</h2>

<h2 id="Ch06">VI. Technical Specifications</h2>

<p>The changes are based off C++ Working Draft Standard N3797. The number for a
new paragraph has a place-holder; the final number, plus moving existing ID
numbers to fit, are to be determined later.</p>

<p>In section 8.5.1 [dcl.init.aggr], modify paragraph 1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-1-</strong> An <dfn>aggregate</dfn> is an array or a
  <ins>single-source</ins> class (Clause 9) with no user-provided constructors
  (12.1) <ins>among it and its base classes (Clause 10) and</ins><del>, no
  private or protected</del> <ins>the same access control for any</ins>
  non-static data members (Clause 11) <ins>in the source class</ins><del>, no
  base classes (Clause 10), and no virtual functions (10.3)</del>. <ins>The
  members of an array aggregate are its elements. The members of a class
  aggregate are the named non-static data members of its source class,
  including the aggregate members of anonymous class members. [<em>Note:</em>
  The members of a class aggregate are the ones that could be designated in a
  <var>mem-initializer</var> for a theoretical constructor of the source class
  (12.6.2). <em>&mdash;end note</em>]</ins> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifying what an aggregate's members are here avoids cramming it in the
next paragraph. But the specification makes 8.5.1/5 redundant. The "including
the aggregate members of anonymous class members" means the members of
anonymous unions and, if added later, non-union class types (like the 2011
version of C).</p>

<p>Modify paragraph 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-2-</strong> When an aggregate is initialized by an initializer
  list, as specified in 8.5.4, the elements of the initializer list are taken
  as initializers for the members of the aggregate, in increasing subscript or
  member order. Each member is copy-initialized from the corresponding
  <var>initializer-clause</var>. <ins>If the source class or its non-static
  data members for an aggregate class are not accessible from the context of
  the initializer list, the program is ill-formed. [<em>Example:</em></ins></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre><ins>class Z;
Z hello();

class Z {
  friend Z hello();
  int z;
};
Z hello() {
  Z zz{ 1 };
  return zz;
}
int main() {
  Z yy = { 2 };  <i>// error</i>
  Z xx = hello();  <i>// OK</i>
}</ins></pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p><ins>The non-static data member of aggregate class <code>Z</code> is
  <code>private</code>, so only entities that are internal or friendly to
  <code>Z</code> may access that member through aggregate initialization.
  <em>&mdash;end example</em>]</ins> If the <var>initializer-clause</var> is an
  expression and a narrowing conversion (8.5.4) is required to convert the
  expression, the program is ill-formed. [<em>Note:</em> If an
  <var>initializer-clause</var> is itself an initializer list, the member is
  list-initialized, which will result in a recursive application of the rules
  in this section if the member is an aggregate. <em>&mdash;end note</em>]
  [<em>Example:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>struct A {
  int x;
  struct B {
    int i;
    int j;
  } b;
} a = { 1, { 2, 3 } };</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>initializes <code>a.x</code> with 1, <code>a.b.i</code> with 2,
  <code>a.b.j</code> with 3. <em>&mdash;end example</em>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the root section of Clause 9 [class], add a paragraph before paragraph
7:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-A-</strong> The <dfn>set of source classes</dfn> for a class
  consists of the union of its base classes' sets of source classes plus, when
  it declares at least one non-static data member, the class itself. A class is
  a <dfn>single-source class</dfn> if its set of source classes either is
  empty, contains only the class itself, or contains just the type of a
  singularly occurring base-class subobject. [<em>Note:</em> If a single-source
  class inherits non-static data members from a base class, then the base class
  must be inherited from once and/or have all its inheritances be
  <code>virtual</code>. <em>&mdash;end note</em>] For a given single-source
  class, its <dfn>source class</dfn> is the (sole) class in its set of source
  classes, or the single-source class itself if the set is empty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modify paragraph 7:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-7-</strong> A <dfn>standard-layout class</dfn> is a class that
  <ins>has</ins>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><del>has</del> no non-static data members of type non-standard-layout
      class (or array of such types) or reference,</li>
    <li><del>has</del> no virtual functions (10.3) and no virtual base classes
      (10.1),</li>
    <li><del>has</del> the same access control (Clause 11) for all non-static
      data members,</li>
    <li><del>has</del> no non-standard-layout base classes,</li>
    <li><del>either has no non-static data members in the most derived class
      and at most one base class with non-static data members, or has no base
      classes with non-static data members</del> <ins>at most one element in
      its set of source classes</ins>, and</li>
    <li><del>has</del> no base classes of the same type as the first non-static
      data member.<sup>110</sup></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>(Footnote 110 is unchanged.) The main inserted part of the paragraph does
not say "single-source class" since the wording of the main deleted part does
not exclude a data-bearing base class from being (non-virtually) inherited from
more than once. (Also, is the "most derived" phrase in the deleted part an
error, since there is no mention of what happens if a derived class between the
most derived class and the class to be tested for standard layout, excluding
the former and including the latter, is data-bearing?)</p>

<p>In section 12.6.2 [class.base.init], modify paragraph 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-5-</strong> A <var>ctor-initializer</var> may initialize a
  variant member of the constructor&rsquo;s class. If a
  <var>ctor-initializer</var> specifies more than one
  <var>mem-initializer</var> for the same member or for the same base class,
  the <var>ctor-initializer</var> is ill-formed. <ins>If a
  <var>ctor-initializer</var> specifies a <var>mem-initializer</var> for an
  aggregate direct base class that derives from a virtual base class with
  non-static data members and a separate <var>mem-initializer</var> for an
  aggregate base class that derives from or is the same virtual base class, the
  <var>ctor-initializer</var> is ill-formed.</ins></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modify paragraph 7:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-7-</strong> The <var>expression-list</var> or
  <var>braced-init-list</var> in a <var>mem-initializer</var> is used to
  initialize the designated subobject (or, in the case of a delegating
  constructor, the complete class object) according to the initialization rules
  of 8.5 for direct-initialization. [<em>Example:</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>struct B1 { B1(int); /* ... */ };
struct B2 { B2(int); /* ... */ };
struct D : B1, B2 {
  D(int);
  B1 b;
  const int c;
};

D::D(int a) : B2(a+1), B1(a+2), c(a+3), b(a+4)
  { /* ... */ }
D d(10);</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>&mdash;end example</em>] The initialization performed by each
  <var>mem-initializer</var> constitutes a full-expression. Any expression in a
  <var>mem-initializer</var> is evaluated as part of the full-expression that
  performs the initialization. A <var>mem-initializer</var> where the
  <var>mem-initializer-id</var> denotes <ins>either</ins> a virtual base class
  <ins>or an aggregate direct base class deriving from a virtual base class
  with non-static data members</ins> is ignored during execution of a
  constructor of any class that is not the most derived class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A (non-aggregate) class specifying an aggregate for a direct base class,
where that base class inherits (directly or indirectly) virtually from its
source class, provides a new path for a virtual class subobject to be
initialized within a constructor, so it must not be evaluated when the
constructor's class is not the most derived class. (The direct base class has
no potentially-skipped initialization outside the virtual base class, otherwise
it could not be an aggregate.)</p>
