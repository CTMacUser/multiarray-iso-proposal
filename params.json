{"name":"Multiarray-iso-proposal","tagline":"Proposal for ISO C++ to modify std::array for extent counts besides one","body":"### About this Proposal\r\nThis proposal extends `std::array` from taking one extent for being built around a single-dimension array to arbitrary extents to encapsulate multidimensional arrays.  The extent list is implemented with the variadic template feature introduced in C++ 2011.\r\n\r\n###Discussion\r\n\r\n1. [Initial discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/d/topic/std-proposals/s17-s_LXLT8/discussion) of this proposal in early September 2013\r\n2. [A second round of discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/d/topic/std-proposals/OMsTJWnCqKA/discussion) of this proposal in early October 2013\r\n\r\nThese discussions were in the [Google Group for ISO C++ Future Proposals](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/std-proposals) forum.\r\n\r\n###Proposals\r\n\r\n1. [N3794](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3794.html), the proposal after those first two rounds of discussion\r\n\r\nYou can find drafts, plus references, in the corresponding repository for this site (in the \"master\" branch).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n###Other Proposals\r\n\r\n1. The [latest draft](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/CTMacUser/multiarray-iso-proposal/master/array-proposal.html) of the array proposal\r\n2. An idea to [provide an initialized `std::va_list` object](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/CTMacUser/multiarray-iso-proposal/master/va-proposal.html) instead of doing the (C-level) variable-argument boiler-plate code yourself\r\n3. An idea to [add C-1999 designators](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/CTMacUser/multiarray-iso-proposal/master/designation-proposal.html) (as part of (aggregate) initializers) to C++.\r\n4. A set of new [type-traits for arrays](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/CTMacUser/multiarray-iso-proposal/master/array-traits-proposal.html).  Split off from N3794.\r\n5. A set of new [type-traits covering transformations from the Standard](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/CTMacUser/multiarray-iso-proposal/master/std-xform-proposal.html).\r\n6. A pair of new [creation functions for pointer classes](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/CTMacUser/multiarray-iso-proposal/master/weak-shared-proposal.html) converting between smart- and weak-pointers.\r\n7. An idea to [loosen restrictions on aggregates](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/CTMacUser/multiarray-iso-proposal/master/expanded-aggregate-proposal.html) to permit more class types to qualify.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
